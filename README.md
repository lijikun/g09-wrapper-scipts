Gaussian 09 wrapper Bash scripts.


## g09template.sh

Converts a batch of molecular definition files [e.g. xyz coordinates or z-matrix] to g09 input files, according to a template specified by the user. 

Also generates a script file to run all the calculations.

Usage:

        ./g09template.sh template molecule1 [molecule2 ...] [-n number-of-processors] [-s script-file-name] 

See [`g09template-sample-opt.gjf`](g09template-sample-opt.gjf) for a sample template. Basically, the template defines the model chemistry, basis sets, optimization, etc., that you want to apply to all the molecules.

How to write a template:

 1. Write a file as if it's a normal g09 input file.

 2. Put `!chkfile!` for the line that specifies the checkpoint file name.

 3. Put `!nprocs!` for the line with number of CPUs.

 4. Put `!title!` for the comment line.

 5. Put `!coordinates!` where the molecule definition should be.
 
 6. You can put the line for charge and multiplicity (fragment charge/multiplicity, too) in either (but not both)
 
    * The template (if every molecule has the same charge and multiplicity), or 
        
    * The molecule definition files (if there are differenct charges, etc. among molecules)

For example, supposing you have in current directory the script, the template, as well as `mol-a.xyz`, `mol-b.xyz` and `mol-c.xyz`, which are generated by [Avogadro](http://avogadro.cc) or Chem3D), you can run:

        ./g09template.sh g09template-sample-opt.gjf *.xyz -n 8
        
        
And it will generate files automatically named like `mol-a_g09template-sample-opt.gjf`. The checkpoint files will be named accordingly. The script file is unspecified so will be automatically named `g09template-sample-opt.gjf.sh`, and made executable.


## g09run.sh

Runs a g09 calculation, and emails the last 10 lines of log when finished.

Usage:

        ./g09run.sh input-file [email-address]
